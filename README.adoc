= CN1RPC
A library to facilitate RPC between Codename One clients and Java servers

== Synopsis

This library provides a minimal set of annotations to generate RPC client and server code for Codename One applications.  The library itself meant to be used in Java server projects, but it includes a mechanism to seamlessly keep client projects in sync.

== Usage

To create a web service that uses Codename One RPC, simply add the `@WebService` annotation to any class in your project.  Then all `public` `static` methods in that class will be accessible to your Codename One client using RPC (remote procedure calls).

A simple example:

[source,java]
----
package com.example.myadder;

import com.codename1.ws.annotations.WebService;

@WebService
public class TestWebServer {
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a+b;
    }
}
----
